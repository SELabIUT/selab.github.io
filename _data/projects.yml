- title: "An Empirical Study on Neophytes of Stack Overflow: How welcoming the community is towards them"
  members: Suzad Mohammad, Abdullah Al Jubair, Zahin Raidah Maisha
  description: "Stack Overflow has become a well-known Q&amp;A platform for programmers with a rapidly
    expanding community of new users. However, a considerable portion of these new
    users claim to face hostile environments which is a major concern and hindrance
    towards the enhancement of a skillful community. In our work, we investigate this
    group of users and term them as “Neophytes”, binding conditions of either being a
    registered user of not more than 45 days or having a reputation less than or equal to 50.
    We organized our research work into two research questions where we investigate
    whether neophytes actually face hurdles in Stack Overflow and if so, identify the
    reasons for it with both qualitative and quantitative analysis. We find that: 1) Yes,
    Neophytes face hurdles in Stack Overflow; 2) The reasons for having a hard time are
    harsh moderation of posts, negligence of the posts, Deletion or Closing of posts,
    Downvoting without providing any proper reasoning etc. Our findings can be used to
    guide in future works where we observe the reaction of neophytes in adverse situations
    and recommend some steps for positive change to the community."

- title: "Topic-wise Difficulty based Questions Recommendation to users on StackOverflow"

  description: "Among all the questions that arise on Stack Overflow on a regular basis it is both difficult and time consuming to find a convenient question which a user can answer properly. Stack Overflow provides a tag filtering system in this essence but it doesn’t provide any mechanism to recommend questions to a user according to their frequent working domains and expertise level. Now we are going to implement a method that will classify questions in different difficulty levels and more granular level of topics when a question arises and notifies any user according to his frequently answered question which includes both his interest and expertise level."
